# Cosmic Misery

## About
The game is going to be set in an alien world. You run along the never ending landscape shooting enemies and gaining points.

## Current Game
update1: This is a simple 2d side-scroller game made using Phaser.js. At this point in time you are a simple rectangle with a rectangle [gun] attached to you. This follows the mouse and shoots projectiles out of it. You can navigate the never ending map. At the moment the background is a parallax of ground, mountains, and sky. There are also enemies that come towards you and are killable but do no damage.

update2: The character model is now animating and the arm follows the mouse smoothly.

update3: The map is now fullscreen and there are randomely generating holes.

Currently Playable At: https://bradysbaker.github.io/shooterGame1/ [offline for now]
